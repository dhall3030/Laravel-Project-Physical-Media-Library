# My project's README

This is intended to be another iteration of the media library application I was building in an older repository. This version will be built using Laravel 5.5 and will maintain user roles. The application will allow multiple users to register and catalog collection of their physical media such as CDs, DVDs Blue-rays, and game disks. I will also include a rest API which can be consumed by a potential mobile app.
